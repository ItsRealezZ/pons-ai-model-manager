App <-> Pons Interfaces
- API
- Environment Variables
- Pons python interface library

API 
- Get Model Path by Name
- Get Model Path by MD5
- Request download of new model

How does a third party app:
- Identify if Pons is available
- Request path to a model
- Request to download a new model

Is there value in setting up policy?
- Apps request and register access to models
- Pons prompts user to verify request
- Similar to a phone app requesting permissions
